    "frequently.h6":"Can I use a 3G or 4G connection to connect my screens to Internet?",
    "frequently.p6":"Yes, you can but you should consider couple things. First of all, you can’t connect the USB modem directly to the Promobox. You need a 3G router that you plug in to the Promobox with a cable. Also the data plans can be expensive. HD video and image material used these days can be quite large. Even though there’s data traffic only when uploading the files or making changes you should keep this in mind when making your mobile data plan.",
